# Duelyst Deck Builder
## by ebuchmann

## Where it can be found
[duelystcards.com](http://duelystcards.com/)

### TODO
- Add general spell icon to card
- Fix mobile breakpoints for card lists so they aren't squished
- "No cards" for sections without cards (option to clear the filter)
- Apply filters and search to general list
- Add a "remove" button on cards
- Clicking minion sprite in the deck list clicks that card, instead of what the mouse is actually over
- Deck name, becomes file name / title on imgur

### Improvements
- URL shortener
- Build your own card screen
- Deck stats
  - Minion health / defence / mana cost curves
  - spell and artifact curves
  - Ability list (3 provoke, 2 dying wish, etc.)
